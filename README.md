# Tranzit Fast Travel
Another... day, another feature
I had a thought of adding in a fast travel system to Tranzit with the ability to activate it by doing a simple ee step.

## Installation
Download tranzitfasttravel.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

(if the folder isnt there create them)


OR you may use the source code/uncompiled version by using tranzitfasttravel_sourcecode.gsc but if you don't know what youre doing in terms of GSC, I highly recommend you use the first choice

## Configuration
This mod contains a few configurable options!

```set value 0/1```

``fasttravel_price`` - Set the price for what you want the fast travel to be - Default: 1500

``fasttravel_activateonpower`` - Determine whether you want the Fast Travel to activate when the power turns on or keep it normal where itll require an additional step to activate - Default: 0

## How to Activate Fast Travel
Fast Travel can be pretty convient but in order to get them working. Youll need to do a few simple steps.

1. Make sure the power is turned on
2. Go near the desk in the bank, youll see a prompt telling you to activate the portals. Press your Interact button to activate it.
3. All travel portals are activated
